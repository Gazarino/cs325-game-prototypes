<center><h2>Vengeful Battle</h2></center>
<ul class="u">

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Manage your power resources and attempt to predict your opponent's actions to beat them in battle.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This prototype uses keyboard input. It's a deterministic (sort of) competitive type game for 2 players.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience a thought-filled battle with a big focus on planning and predicting enemy moves.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Using the mouse, both players (independently) choose to do 0-4 actions, picking a type and power level for each.</li>
<li>Possible actions are Charge, Attack, Heal, and Counter. Each one has its own power bank, which can hold up to 4 power. An action cannot be used without at least 1 power.</li>
<li>Players start with 100 health, and lose when it reaches 0. Attack does 10*power damage, and Heal restores 8*power health. Counter hits back an attack, dealing 6*power*(powerOfEnemyAttack) damage.</li>
<li>Charge adds power to the next action performed during the battle phase.</li>
<li>After both players enter all input, battle begins and the players' entered actions are carried out in sequence. Heals always occur before an attack hits. Counter (usually) does nothing if the other player did not attack.</li>
<li>Players enter input again for the next battle phase, and battling continues until someone runs out of health.</li>
<li>After every battle phase, 1 power in the Charge, Attack, Heal, and Counter power banks is restored.</li>
<li>Additionally, a player's Attack power bank gets +1 when that player is damaged by the opponent's attack, and a player's Charge power bank gets +1 when that player takes 50 or more damage at once.</li>
<li>The 4 power banks cannot carry more than 4 power each, making it wasteful to not use all types of actions.</li>
<li>By pressing the "Special Charge" button, a player converts a sum of 5 power into a special charge. This grants an effect based on the following action:</li>
<li>Attack -> Pierce Attack (opponent's counters can be broken through by attacks)</li>
<li>Heal -> Chronic Heal (blasts do 1/3 the usual damage to the user)</li>
<li>Counter -> Almighty Counter (the user's counters reduce/inverse the effects of heal; -6*powerBlue*powerRed)</li>
<li>All of these only last for the battle phase they are used in and the following battle phase.</li>
<li>Although you can use a special one turn after another, you may only have one active at a time so the old one will be overwritten.</li>
<div id="spoiler" style="display:none"><br>
Woah! SOMEONE wants to kill the winner! This someone has a couple advantages to help accomplish this task:
<li>Gain 1 extra charge after each battle phase.</li>
<li>Different specials! </li>
<li>-Stun Attack (opponent cannot use two actions in a row)</li>
<li>-Drain Heal (user's heals damage the opponent 8*power in addition to healing)</li>
<li>-Deny Counter (opponent cannot counter)</li>
</div>
<button title="Click to show/hide content" type="button" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=='none') {document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=''}else{document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display='none'}">Show/hide end of game spoiler</button>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test a prediction-based battle system (which isn't real-time or turn-based).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Players have a lot of freedom and options in terms of how much they want to do. Each action option has its own resource bank
which slowly regenerates, so there is good reason to vary your actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in a dark, flooded, mountainous grassland. The characters are two long-time rivals who have become
separated by cliffs and water. It is said that the one in red angered the earth god, causing the cliffs, plateaus, and mountains,
and the one in blue angered the water god, causing the floods. These two have now found each other and have decided to have a
to-the-death battle from opposite plateaus using their mysterious newfound powers...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who enjoy planning and predicting the actions of others.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Approximately 5-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Secretly save 4 charge and 4 attack power, then charge -> attack for 80 damage!</li>
<li>Save 4 counter power, and counter with 1 power 4 times to negate all damage for one battle phase.</li>
<li>Attack with 3-4 power to avoid giving your opponent too much extra power.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Music: <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Rolemusic/">Rolemusic</a>; includes Savage Steel Fun Club, La la triroriro, Improvisation at lovers cavern, and Neoishiki.</li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f9/11/f7/f911f7b8d003dc47920e1b52b2f179d9.jpg">Image</a></li>
<li>Sprites: <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/rpg-character">Characters</a></li>

<li>(Everything else is self-made.)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<a href="https://phoebe3315.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/revenge/">Original "Vengeful Battle" prototype.</a>
For this version I have overhauled the input system for a custom GUI which makes it much easier to understand
what you're doing. I have also adjusted the rules (mainly about charge and special charge), and added a surprise at the end...
