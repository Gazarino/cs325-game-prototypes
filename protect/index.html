<center><h2>Zachary's Escape</h2></center>
<ul class="u">

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use various weapons by placing them in a moving environment and not letting any get left behind to stop enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who needs to be protected (dogs are people too).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To feel stressed, faced with a high-tension situation which promotes an action which puts the
player at risk of losing the ability to fight.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Survive for 3 minutes to make it out of the forest and win. If a single enemy makes it to Zachary, it's game over.</li>
<li>The player can make use of four different weapons to stop the enemy:</li>
<ul><li>A standard laser gun, which shoots quickly in straight lines. (4 dmg/hit)</li>
<li>A heat-seeking rocket launcher. The rockets move slowly and don't last as long, but they auto-target the nearest enemy. (8 dmg/hit)</li>
<li>A sword. It can shoot beams with each swing. They don't travel far, but they move very fast. (20 dmg/hit)</li>
<li>A spiny shield. It can push back enemies and damage them on contact, but too much contact will cause it to shatter. (2 dmg/hit)</li></ul>
<br>
<li>To use a weapon, drag it into the play area. The laser gun and rocket launcher will automatically fire.
The A and D keys rotate the currently held weapon. They also are used to swing the sword.</li>
<li>Of course, only one weapon can be held at a time. Weapons can be dropped in the play area and be helpful, but be careful!
If any go offscreen, there's no getting them back. The R key can be pressed to return all dropped weapons which
are still on screen to your inventory.</li>
<li>The spacebar toggles the speed Zachary is running. Enemies will take twice as long to get to him if
he's running fast, but dropped weapons will be in much greater danger of going off screen!</li>
<li>These enemies come in four sizes. The smallest only takes damage if its head is hit.
The larger they are, the more health they have; the largest has 250 HP, 2.5 times that of the smallest!</li>
<li>These enemies are also very adaptive. If one takes 50 damage in a row by the same weapon,
that weapon will start doing only half the damage until a different weapon damages it!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test a defender-type game where the defending units can all be used at the start with no cost,
but are continuously in danger of being lost.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are four unique weapons which can be used together if one or more are dropped. A constantly moving background requires
players to make quick decisions regarding dropped weapons.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a caring owner of a little dog you've named Zachary, and you enjoy going to new places with him.
One day you decided to take him into a nearby forest. After a bit of exploration, you find a case with
some odd weapons inside it. Suddenly you hear an awful cry and look up to see other-worldly creatures running toward you!
Little did you know, these creatures, called Ziclaudians, have stationed their base in this forest and you've
stumbled onto their grounds! You grab the case of weapons and run the other way with Zack.
You don't know why, but it seems the Ziclaudians just want Zack. It turns out they are collecting different Earth
life forms and have never seen a little dog such as him before. You have to protect him!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who enjoy high-intensity, action-oriented gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
3 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tell Zack to run fast whenever there are no dropped weapons in play!</li>
<li>Since it aims itself, there's little reason not to drop the rocket launcher in play. Use another weapon as it fires!</li>
<li>Are the ziclaudians dangerously close to lil' Zack? Drop the spiny shield in front of them and tell him to run fast!
(Make sure to press R before it goes offscreen.)</li>
<li>Don't want to drop weapons? Make sure to frequently change the one you're using.
Be careful; even with Zack running, it often takes too long to kill the ziclaudians using only one weapon at a time.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For this assignment, the small amount of code I borrowed was from my previous assignments (like the code in Warapsha enemies use to find the nearest bullet).
I didn't borrow code from a Phaser example and I don't really know another game like this...
