<center><h2>Preserve Warapsha</h2></center>
<ul class="u">

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Survive and defeat enemies by warping around your bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Preservationist
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is a deterministic shooter with keyboard input and an achiever play style.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To feel a sense of accomplishment after struggling during demanding gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
(Recommended: Before reading this, read the setting/premise and story, then play the in-game tutorial.)
<ul>
<li>Arrow Keys = move/rotate player</li>
<li>Spacebar = warp player across the window center</li>
<li>W/A/S/D = warp bullets up/left/down/right</li>
<li>1/2/3 = change degree to switch bullets warp</li>
<li>E = activate 5 second long invincibility</li>
<li>The player's mech isn't working properly; it's shooting out all of your bullets!
Thankfully, Warapsha is on your side. It will keep your bullets in orbit and let you warp them (as well as your mech) around!
The player needs to both avoid bullets and move them around to defeat enemies. An enemy will come into play as often as every 12 seconds and
shoot at the player. Enemies (and the player) explode after receiving 10 bullets (although the player can
take up to 40 of his/her own). Survive and take out at least 5 enemies to win!</li>
<div id="spoiler" style="display:none"><br>
Additional controls unlocked after winning the game:
<li>Q = move twice as fast</li>
<li>F = fire bullets</li>
<li>R = reset/reload all bullets</li>
<li>Your gun is fixed! Now you can shoot of your own accord and wreck enemies in the bonus mode, where your gun won't
automatically shoot and enemies spawn as often as every 4 seconds! There's nothing more satisfying than consciously firing a stream of bullets and then warping them into
your enemy's face when they try to dodge! Keep in mind you can only have 220 bullets in play at once;
after you've shot that many, you'll need to reset/reload before you can shoot any more.</li>
</div>
<button title="Click to show/hide content" type="button" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=='none') {document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display=''}else{document.getElementById('spoiler') .style.display='none'}">Show/hide end of game spoiler</button>
</ul>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test a shooter where bullets can be manipulated and aiming is done to create bullet patterns as opposed to hitting targets.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The ability to create and manipulate bullet patterns.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are an explorer with a highly advanced mech that allows you to easily fly through deep space.
One day you discovered a very unique celestial body which, despite being tiny, causes many things to orbit around it.
You found that rather than being ultra dense, this place has the power to bend nearby space!
It was very dark blue with sections of space distortion making it appear liquid,
and according to your mech's measurements, it wasn't too dangerous to land on.
While wondering around the wondrous surface, some small rocks began warping around and circling you.
Unsure of how to react, you extended your mech's arm as if inviting an animal to sniff your hand.
The movement of the rocks slowed, and one drifted to the outstretched hand of your mech, meeting with the fingertips.
That's when you realized that this place, which you've now named "Warapsha", has a soul!
As you spent more time on its surface, you communicated with Warapsha and became its friend!
However, it wasn't long before more people stumbled upon Warapsha and made plans to change it forever...
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You peacefully enter the ship of your fellow humans and attempt to convince them to leave Warapsha alone, but they won't listen!
Warapsha makes it clear to you that it doesn't want those people making it into their personal home and test subject.
Determined to help, you embed some of Warapsha's DNA into your mech and your bullets, giving you the power
to warp them around with Warapsha's help. It's time for battle! ...But something seems off with your mech.
One of the other humans didn't mess with it when you tried to convince them not to take over, did they...?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who enjoy high-pressure gameplay and shoot-em-ups.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
2-3 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you're constantly getting hit by your own bullets, you're moving too much. Consider the fact that it's possible to win without using the arrow keys.</li>
<li>Create helpful, recognizable bullet patterns by aiming and warping the bullets as they come out.</li>
<li>Can't focus on the enemy because you're too worried about getting hit? Press E and take 'em out within 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>**This game is based off the soundtrack of the anime "Vandread" (composed by Yasunori Iwasaki).
The story and gameplay have very little in common with Vandread, but all of the music comes from it.
Tracks used include "Super Vandread", "Vandread Meia", "Dread", "Ooinaru Gaika", and "Dogfight".</li>
