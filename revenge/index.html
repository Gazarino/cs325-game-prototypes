<h2>Vengeful Battle</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Manage your power resources and attempt to predict your opponent's actions to beat them in battle.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This prototype uses keyboard input. It's a deterministic (sort of) competitive type game for 2 players.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience a thought-filled battle with a big focus on planning and predicting enemy moves.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Using the arrow keys, both players (independently) choose to do 0-4 actions, then pick which actions to take and how much power to put behind each.</li>
<li>Possible actions are Charge, Attack, Heal, and Counter. Each one has its own power bank, which can hold up to 4 power. Using an action with 0 power does nothing.</li>
<li>Players start with 100 health, and lose when it reaches 0. Attack does 10*power damage, and Heal restores 8*power health. Counter hits back an attack, dealing 6*power*(powerOfEnemyAttack) damage.</li>
<li>Charge adds power to the next action performed, changing power limits from 0-(powerInBank) to (chargedPower)-(powerInBank + chargedPower).</li>
<li>After both players enter all input, battle begins and the 1st action players entered is carried out, then the 2nd, etc. (with the press of the spacebar). Heals always occur before an attack hits. Counter does nothing if the other player did not attack.</li>
<li>Players enter input again for the next 0-4 actions, and battling continues until someone runs out of health.</li>
<li>After every battle phase, 1 power in the Charge, Attack, Heal, and Counter power banks is restored.</li>
<li>Additionally, a player's Attack power bank gets +1 when that player is damaged by the opponent's attack, and a player's Charge power bank gets +1 when that player takes 50 or more damage at once.</li>
<li>The 4 power banks cannot carry more than 4 power each, making it wasteful to not use all types of actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test a prediction-based battle system (which isn't real-time or turn-based).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Players have a lot of freedom and options in terms of how much they want to do. Each action option has its own resource bank
which slowly regenerates, so there is good reason to vary your actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in a dark, flooded, mountainous grassland. The characters are two long-time rivals who have become
separated by cliffs and water. It is said that the one in red angered the earth god, causing the cliffs, plateaus, and mountains,
and the one in blue angered the water god, causing the floods. These two have now found each other and have decided to have a
to-the-death battle from opposite plateaus using their mysterious newfound powers...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who enjoy planning and predicting the actions of others.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Approximately 4-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Secretly save 4 charge and 4 attack power, then charge -> attack for 80 damage!</li>
<li>Save 4 counter power, and counter with 1 power 4 times to negate all damage for one battle phase.</li>
<li>Attack with 3-4 power to avoid giving your opponent too much extra power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
