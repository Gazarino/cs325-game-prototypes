<center><h2>Matches of the Sky</h2></center>
<ul class="u">

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fly to the flow of a song and judge how well your opponent does.
</li>

<li><strong>Themes:</strong>
Owner of a pet shop, dance.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To consider and have fun with the flow of music and process of judging.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Before you can do anything else, you need to talk to the owner of the pet shop and buy a pet.
Doing so will allow you to go into training and solo competitions. If a person on both files purchases a pet,
multiplayer competitions will open up and the two can compete against each other! Just be aware competitions
cost money. If you run out of money, there's not much you can do other than go to training and hope you
can attract an audience.</li>
<li>**The below information assumes the standard control method. Controls can be changed in the pet shop after
visiting training mode.</li>
<li>Go to "Training" in game for a listing of which keys do what. Changing angle/speed/depth is done with 1 key each;
the first time the angle key is pressed your pet will tilt its head upward, and the second time it will tilt downward.
If you want to tilt up slightly then slightly up again without tilting down, simply press the Keep key (E) first.</li>
<li>The trick performed by Q will be a U-turn if the animal is flapping its wings and a loop if it is gliding.
These will by default tilt up, but they will tilt down if the flight mode key is held. If your pet is flapping its
wings and you want to do a U-turn without going into gliding mode, press E then hold F and press Q.</li>
<li>Your pet cannot glide without going at least a certain speed. It must be going even faster to be able to loop.
Up to three loops can be performed consecutively by pressing Q again before the loop finishes. Angle/speed/depth/flight
mode cannot be changed while looping, so F can easily be held down before pressing Q to perform figure 8's.</li><br>
<li>The main game involves 2 players; one first performs while the other judges, then they switch. The one with the most
points by the end wins. Each player gets two sets of points; performance points and judgement points.
Performance points are awarded solely based on the player's performance in terms how well their movements match the
flow of the song. These points are awarded if the performer...
<ul><li>Matches the (approximate) pitch of notes with the angle the creature is pointing. Facing forward at no angle
will give points for notes which appear in the middle of the notebox, while pointing up as much as possible will
award points for notes at the top of the notebox and pointing to the ground will award points at the bottom.</li>
<li>Matches the prominence of notes with the depth of the creature. Color indicates depth order and is organized
based on hot/cold color: RED is most prominent, then orange, then yellow, then hazy/whitish blue, then blue.
Get close up for red notes, slightly further back for yellow, and as far back as possible for blue!</li>
<li>Matches the length of notes with the right flight mode. Notes which are over four times their height in length
will award points for gliding, while shorter notes will award points for flapping wings. Not sure which to do?
Do a trick; during a loop/U-turn, these points will be given regardless of flight mode.</li>
<li>Matches the approximate speed of a section. Sections are indicated by a grey box, and the more shading there
is, the faster you should be going to get the most points.</li></ul></li>
<li>The judge is required to grade the player on a 4-point scale (4 being best) for each section. After a section ends,
the judge will have until the start of the next section (or 7 seconds) to input a number with the UP/DOWN arrow keys.
This number will briefly show in the bottom-right corner and will be automatically submitted. If the judge misses
grading on a section, he/she will be harshly penalized. The judge is free to be biased, but if "1" is submitted
for a section during which the game awarded a large number of points to the performer, or if a "4" is submitted
for a section which the performer got very few points, the judge will be penalized.</li>
<li>In addition to grading, the judge may BOO or WOW at the performer with the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys.
BOO/WOW can only be used once per 10 seconds of the song and will be applied to the performance over the past 7 seconds.
WOW increases the performer's score. If the performer is doing well, the judge gets bonus points.
The judge gets slightly more bonus points if the performer did a trick within the past 7 seconds.
Bonus points given to the judge will never be greater than the points awarded to the performer, but it can end up about equal.
Show wrath disables them both for the next 7 seconds.</li>
<div id="spoiler" style="display:none"><br>
Upon visiting Rose after your first time in training mode, she will give you a special device with tracks your pet's movements!
<li>The numbers on it turn green if you are getting points in that category, and they turn blue if you are
getting max points possible in that category. If you don't like this feature, you can always hide it by pressing H.</li>

</ul>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test how the performer and judge of a rhythm game can influence each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Players have the ability to do collect pets by purchasing them in the pet shop and then fly around/do tricks with their pet(s).
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You've come across a pet shop in the sky! This is where you can get your first mythical beast.
The people of this floating island love sky-flying competitions so it's a good way to make money here.
Thus, you've decided to engage in these activities.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those who enjoy rhythm games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 5-10 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Tips/Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Technically, the performer can shut out the judge's ability to make any distracting comments by showing wrath every 7 seconds.
By not doing this, the performer allows the judge to potentially mess them up with ditractions (hopefully) in exchange for bonus points.
The judge should not BOO several times in a row if they don't want to anger the performer and shut them out for the rest of the song,
with nothing to indicate they might get any extra points. The judge should really try to WOW at places which the player matches well
with the music and/or does a cool trick to give themselves more points; if they end up getting an equal number of points, they essencially
get to throw a free distraction with positive connotation (so the performer hopefully won't feel the need to show wrath).

<ul>
<li>The closest other game is <a href="https://phoebe3315.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/sky/">the previous version of this game</a>.
For this version, I've added several new creatures, a pet shop, and a file system/single player. I also modified how scoring
works and added a way to clearly see what you're getting points on.</li>
